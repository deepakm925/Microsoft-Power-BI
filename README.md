# INTRODUCTION

Here is a repository of my analysis and projects done in Power Business Intelligence (BI). Analyzing various datasets to derive a solution. 

**NOTE**: 
Due to Dashboards and Applications not being able to be uploaded to Github. To display the interactive experience Media GIFs were used.
To experience and actually interact with the Dashboards and Applications. The URL Link to my personal workspace on my Power BI online service will be provided here:
