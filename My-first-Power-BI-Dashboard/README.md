# Creating a POWER BI DASHBOARD- Analyzing Sales, Products, and Factors Influencing Contoso Corporation. 

## Introduction
This was one of my first Dashboards created in Power BI Desktop and uploaded to the Power BI service. The data that was used was a fictitious company called Contoso-Corporation created by Microsoft Learn Corporation. The company's dataset/data can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/contoso-overview?view=o365-worldwide)



## Analysis derived from the Dashboard 

1. A general overview of the Dashboard, where we will look at the **product price, sales, and sum of sales per product. Lastly, Gross Profit**. 

2. Secondly, we will look at how interacting with the Dashboard can be helpful by looking at the **Key Influencers**

3. Thirdly, we will interact with the Dashboard again to see the **Top Segments**.

4. Lastly, a Question and Answer (Q&A) was implemented in the dashboard we can ask a question of the data provided.


(*Each point will be elaborated below...*)
