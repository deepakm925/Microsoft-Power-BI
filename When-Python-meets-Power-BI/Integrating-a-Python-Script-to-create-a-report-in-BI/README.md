  # INTEGRATING A PYTHON SCRIPT TO LOAD, CLEAN, VISUALIZE DATA IN POWER BI DESKTOP

  ## DESCRIPTION
Here we will see how interactive and dynamic the Power BI application is by importing, cleaning, and visualizing data all by using Python and its respective libraries. 

## WHAT TO EXPECT...
1. First, create a Python environment using Anaconda Navigator and install all the necessary Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. 


## VISUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STEPS WITH GIFS

First, we will set up the Python Environment within Anaconda. Anaconda is very quick and efficient in creating and managing environments. The environment created will be called `power-bi`. We will then import the necessary libraries that will be used. For this project we will stick with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
