# IMPORTING A POWER BI REPORT USING PYTHON, INTO A JUPYTER-NOTEBOOK

## DESCRIPTION
In this Project, we will continue to experiment with the dynamic data presentation capabilities of Python by embedding a Power BI report in a **Jupyter Notebook**. 

### Overview of the dataset
The CarMax dataset is a CSV file, with at least one (1) million rows. The dataset is a web scrape of the CarMax website and details the daily inventory of cars between September 27, 2015, and June 14, 2017.
