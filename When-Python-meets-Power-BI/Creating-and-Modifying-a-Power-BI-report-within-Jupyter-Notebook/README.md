  # CREATING AND MODIFYING A POWER BI REPORT USING PYTHON AND POWER BI TOOLS, IN JUPYTER-NOTEBOOK
  # INTRODUCTION PAGE


## DESCRIPTION
In this Project, we will test the capabilities of Power BI and Python to a whole new level by creating a report. We will then go ahead and edit the report's visualizations using actual BI visuals and their components, publish it our Power BI online service, and then finally create a Dashboard to show our findings!

### Overview of the dataset
For this Project, a famous and well known dataset will be used called the **IMDB-Movies-Dataset**. This dataset can be found on a popular website for data science datasets called Kaggle
