  # CREATING AND MODIFYING A POWER BI REPORT USING PYTHON AND POWER BI TOOLS, IN JUPYTER-NOTEBOOK
  # INTRODUCTION PAGE


## DESCRIPTION
In this Project, we will test the capabilities of Power BI and Python to a whole new level by first importing, wrangling data, and creating a Power BI report all by using Python. Then we will go ahead and edit the report's visualizations using actual Power BI visuals and some of their components as it would be on Power BI Desktop. Finally, we will save and publish the report to our Power BI online service, and then create a Dashboard to show our findings!

### Overview of the dataset
For this Project, a famous and well known dataset will be used called the **IMDB-Movies-Dataset**. This dataset can be found on a popular website for data science datasets called Kaggle
