  # CREATING AND MODIFYING A POWER BI REPORT USING PYTHON AND POWER BI TOOLS, IN JUPYTER-NOTEBOOK
  # PART 1 :  IMPORTING AND WRANGLING DATA WITH PYTHON 

## DESCRIPTION
This is **PART 1** of the Project **# CREATING AND MODIFYING A POWER BI REPORT USING PYTHON AND POWER BI TOOLS, IN JUPYTER-NOTEBOOK**. In this first part, we will import and wrangle the data using Python. 


## WHAT TO EXPECT...
1. First, install the necessary libraries and import the dataset
2. Then begin our data cleaning step by analyzing the missing/null values and dropping them
3. Dropping unwanted columns that are not adequate for the analysis
4. Editing columns such as transforming, splitting, and changing data type
5. Load a clean version of the dataset
