  # CREATING AND MODIFYING A POWER BI REPORT USING PYTHON AND POWER BI TOOLS, IN JUPYTER-NOTEBOOK
  # PART 4:  SAVING, AND PUBLISHING THE REPORT TO THE POWER BI ONLINE SERVICE, THEN CREATING A DASHBOARD


## DESCRIPTION
This is **PART 4** of the Project **CREATING AND MODIFYING A POWER BI REPORT USING PYTHON AND POWER BI TOOLS, IN JUPYTER-NOTEBOOK**. This will be the final PART of the project. 
In PART 3 we personalized the Power BI report by modifying its contents. 
In this part of the project, we will publish the report to our Power BI Online service, and from there we will create an interactive Dashboard to present our findings. 

## WHAT TO EXPECT...


## IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STEPS 
Here we will display the implementation phase in Steps with the use of GIFs and the help of code snippets. Let's begin!

### <ins> STEP ONE: SAVING AND PUBLISHING THE REPORT TO POWER BI ONLINE</ins>
In this step, we will Publish the Power BI Report to the Power BI Online Service. IN PART 2 we already created the authenticated link to give the Jupyter-Notebook to access the credentials of the online service. So all we need to do here is just Select Save, title our report, and select the workspace.
