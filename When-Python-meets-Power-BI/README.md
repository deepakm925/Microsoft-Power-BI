# WHEN POWER BI MEETS PYTHON


## DESCRIPTION
In this folder, we will integrate Power BI with the Object-oriented programming language Python, one of the most powerful and efficient programming languages used for Data Analysis, Science, and Machine Learning. 
The objective here is to perform EDA while using both Python and Power BI to create a Power BI report. Finally, the data that will be used from the company called CarMax. 

### Overview of the dataset
The CarMax dataset is a CSV file, with at least one (1) million rows. The dataset is a web scrape of the CarMax website and details the daily inventory of cars between September 27, 2015, and June 14, 2017.

## WHAT TO EXPECT...
#### <ins>Integrating a Python Script to Create a Report in Power BI</ins> *(Go to Project Page [here](https://github.com/deepakm925/Power-BI/tree/main/When-Python-meets-Power-BI/Integrating-a-Python-Script-to-create-a-report-in-BI))*

Setting up a Python environment designated for Power BI using the Anaconda application. Secondly, importing data from a *CSV* file from a Python script, while Using both BI and Python tools to clean, tidy, and transform the data. Finally, using Python code to create visualizations from Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn within BI Desktop. 

#### <ins> Creating and Running a report within Anaconda's Jupyter-Notebook BI</ins> *(Go ro Project Page [here](https://github.com/deepakm925/Power-BI/tree/main/When-Python-meets-Power-BI/Integrating-a-Power-BI-Report-into-Anaconda's-Jupyter-Notebook))*
