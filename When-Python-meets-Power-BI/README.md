# WHEN POWER BI MEETS PYTHON


## DESCRIPTION
In this folder, we will integrate Power BI with the Object-oriented programming language Python, one of the most powerful and efficient programming languages used for Data Analysis, Science, and Machine Learning. 
The objective here is to perform EDA while using both Python and Power BI to create a Power BI report. 

## WHAT TO EXPECT...
#### <ins>INTEGRATING A PYTHON SCRIPT TO LOAD, CLEAN, VISUALIZE DATA IN POWER BI DESKTOP</ins> *(Go to Project Page [here](https://github.com/deepakm925/Power-BI/tree/main/When-Python-meets-Power-BI/Integrating-a-Python-Script-to-create-a-report-in-BI))*

Setting up a Python environment designated for Power BI using the Anaconda application. Secondly, importing data from a *CSV* file from a Python script, while Using both BI and Python tools to clean, tidy, and transform the data. Finally, using Python code to create visualizations from Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn within BI Desktop. 

#### <ins>EMBEDDING AND MANAGING DATA IN A POWER BI REPORT WITHIN ANACONDA'S JUPYTER-NOTEBOOK</ins> *(Go ro Project Page [here](https://github.com/deepakm925/Power-BI/tree/main/When-Python-meets-Power-BI/Integrating-a-Power-BI-Report-into-Anaconda's-Jupyter-Notebook))*
