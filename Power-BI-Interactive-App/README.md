# INTERACTIVE POWER BI APP

## DESCRIPTION
Here, we will be analyzing data from a company called Contoso Corporation. Contoso consists of many manufacturers of various products and targets its customer categories in some countries around the world. A Power BI Application is the chosen method to display the findings in the most appealing way and as best as possible. 

##### THE DATASET
The Data is a sample dataset that can be found on the Microsoft website itself [Access-sample-database](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2120368). The dataset is a fictitious dataset. The database is in a Microsoft Access Database (ADB) format. Therefore will require Access Database Engine to be installed on the working PC before attempting to import the data into Power BI Desktop. Access Database Engine can be downloaded from the Microsoft Official site here : [Access-Database-Engine-Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=54920)

### EXPECTATIONS/ WHAT TO EXPECT
The things that will be looked at in this project are:
- The general interaction and display of a Power BI App and how to interact with it while using Buttons.
- Using Slicers with Geographical Data on World Map Visualization
- Using Slicers as a list to interact across multiple visualization(s)
- Using Time series filters to interact with Time series data across visualizations
- Using Drillthrough on the data
- Using a Power BI App on a Mobile Device.
